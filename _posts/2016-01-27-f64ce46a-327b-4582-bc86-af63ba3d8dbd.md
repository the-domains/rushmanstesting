### Many an enterprise will sit in darkened rooms and consider their futures.

**Usually with the leadership quite disconnected from the rest of their operation.**

And a fair few of them will do a fine job of it. However in our experience a lot of these strategies will fail for one of two reasons.

**1\. They consider execution as something that happens shortly after strategic thinking --- not considered as a part of the same thing or ---**

**2\. They fail to engage with realities within their operation (and the wider context) sufficiently enough to make it happen and for it to become a sustainable part of their business.**

#### That can be a very expensive mistake.

#### Often fatal.
